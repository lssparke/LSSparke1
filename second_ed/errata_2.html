</p><h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>

<p>
<font color="red"> Equation 1.9 </font>  on page 12 gives stellar lifetimes in units of 1Gyr, not 10Gyr; it should read 
log(&#964;<sub>MS</sub>/1Gyr) = 1.015...
and not  
log(&#964;<sub>MS</sub>/10Gyr) = 1.015...
<br>

On page 25, <font color="red"> in Problem 1.7</font> the reference to Table 1.2 and 1.4 should instead be to Tables 1.4 and 1.5.
<font color="red"> Problem 1.8</font> should refer to Table 1.6, not to Table 1.4. <br>
<font color="red"> In Problem 1.9 </font> on page 30, the thermal speed 
of hydrogen atmos at T=100K is about 1.6km/s, so the factor on the right
 side of Equation 1.18 is close to 2300, rather than 3000. <br>

<font color="red"> In Problem 1.11 </font> on page 34, the correct value
 for &#954; is 0.0084.  Light is reduced to 1/e (37%) of its original 
intensity after traveling though about 120cm of gas. <br>
				  
On page 42, the units of surface brightness in <font color="red"> Equation 1.23 </font> are W m<sup>-2</sup>
 per steradian.  In practice, astronomers usually express surface 
brightness either as the apparent magnitude of a star that is as bright 
as one square arcsecond on the sky, or as the number of sunlike stars 
per square parsec that are required to give the observed amount of 
light.  Problem 1.14 shows how to convert between these two measures. <br>
				  
<font color="red"> 
In Problem 1.17 </font> on page 51,
a factor 4&#960; should multiply the expression in Equation 1.35. <br>
Also on page 51: to create a particle pair, the energy of a pair of photons
must exceed 2mc<sup>2</sup> in the rest-frame where their momenta add to zero.
For a pair of photons in blackbody radiation at temperature T, that energy
averages close to 3.2k<sub>B</sub>T (thanks to Carlo del Noce for doing the integrals!) so proton-antiproton pairs will be produced easily when k<sub>B</sub>T &gt; m<sub>p</sub>c<sup>2</sup>.
 <br>
<font color="red"> 
In Problem 1.18 </font> on page 53, k<sub>B</sub>T = 70keV at roughly 
t=350s, rather than t=365s.  (The curious may wonder why this energy is 
so much lower than the binding energy of deuterium.  Because there are 
more than 10<sup>9</sup> photons for each neutron or proton, a deuterium
 nucleus is quickly smashed apart by more-than-averagely-energetic 
photons until the temperature falls well below its binding energy.) <br>
In <font color="red"> 
Problem 1.19 </font> on page 54, the mass-to-light ratio must exceed 30 h<sup>-1</sup> in solar units (not 50 h<sup>-1</sup>).  This is significantly larger than the ratio we will find for the Milky Way in Problem 2.19.

<p>

<font color="red"> 
In Problem 2.7, </font> the dimensions of the ring around supernova 1987a should be 1.62arcsec x 1.18arcsec, not 1.62arcsec x 1.10arcsec as given. <br>
<font color="red"> 
Problem 2.10 </font> should begin "Near the Sun, thin-disk stars make up 90% of the total in the midplane...". <br>
<font color="red"> 
At the end of Section 2.2.3, on page 86: </font> in Table 2.1, we see that the halo stars near the Sun have &#963;<sub>R</sub> &lt;  &#963;<sub>&#966;,z</sub>.
The outer-halo stars have larger random motions in the direction towards
 the Galactic center than in the tangential directions: in spherical 
coordinates (r,&#952;,&#966;) centred at the Galaxy center, we observe 
&#963;<sub>r</sub> &gt;  &#963;<sub>&#952;,&#966;</sub>.
But Table 2.1 does not contain this information.  

				  <br><font color="red"> 
In Problem 2.23 </font> on page 104,
the timescale for a hydrogen atom to collide with a grain is
1Gyr x (1 cm<sup>-3</sup>/ n<sub>H</sub>), or 
10Myr x (100 cm<sup>-3</sup>/ n<sub>H</sub>).  
The last part of the problem then works out correctly. <br>
 <font color="red"> In Problem 2.24 </font> on page 105,
the first term in the expression for S<sub>*</sub> 
is missing a factor of &#960;; it should be  
should be (4 &#960; r<sup>3</sup>/3) and not  (4 r<sup>3</sup>/3).
The radius r<sub>*</sub> is then 0.7pc, and the ionized mass roughly 
40 M<sub>sun</sub>.  The B star ionizes a volume only 3% as large, and 
 r<sub>*</sub>=0.23pc.
<br><font color="red"> In Equation 2.24 </font> on page 108,
the molecular weight of a gas which is 75% molecular hydrogen and 25% 
helium by mass is roughly &#956;=2.3.  The Jeans mass at T=10K for a density 
n=100 cm<sup>-3</sup> is about 30 solar masses, rather than 20 solar masses.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: The Orbits of the Stars</h2><p>
<font color="red"> 
In Problem 3.7 </font> on page 117, the reference to Figure 7.16 should instead be to Figure 8.16. <br>
<font color="red"> 
On page 122, </font> just below Problem 3.13, a better statement would be
"The core radii of open clusters are generally a few parsecs (Table 2.2)." 
The reference to the homogeneous sphere of Problem 3.1 should instead be to Problem 3.11.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: Spiral and S0 Galaxies</h2><p>
<font color="red">  At the start of Section 5.2.1 </font>
we could have included 
this derivation of the diffraction limit: 
a telescope of diameter D observing at wavelength &#955; 
cannot separate sources that are closer on the sky than 
&#952; = &#955;/D. <br> 
A photon's momentum in the direction of travel is h&#957;/c
or  h/&#955;.
When its path makes a small angle &#952; to the axis of the telescope mirror,
 its momentum has a component h&#952;/&#955;  parallel to the mirror. 
If the photon falls on the telescope mirror, the uncertainty in its 
position in the parallel direction cannot be less than D.
So quantum physics tells us that this component of its momentum is not 
known to better than h/D, where h is Planck's constant.
So if we measure &#955; with high precision, &#952; cannot be measured to better 
than &#955;/D. [From V. Radhakrishnan in 'Synthesis Imaging in Radio 
Astronomy II', ASP Conf. Proc. 180, 1999] <br>
<font color="red">  In Problem 5.13 </font> on page 231, the zone in 
which two-armed spiral waves can persist is roughly three times larger 
than that for  four-armed spirals: the ratio is close to (5.8/2.1).  The
 reasoning in the hint on page 419 is correct.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 6: Elliptical Galaxies</h2><p>
On page 270, in the left panel of <font color="red">  Figure 6.20  </font>
 the absolute magnitude scale on the horizontal axis should run from -16
 to -24, not +16 to +24.  The version on the web page is correct.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 7: Galaxy Groups and Clusters</h2><p>
The first sentence of the second paragraph should read 'Groups and clusters
are...', not 'Galaxies and clusters...'<br>
On page 282, <font color="red"> in Equation 7.2 </font> the quantity &#923; should have units
erg cm<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. 
A better version of this equation would read "If each cubic centimeter contains n atoms, the luminosity of a volumne V is L<sub>X</sub> = V n<sup>2</sup> &#923;(T<sub>X</sub>) ..."
In Figure 2.25, recall that cooling at T&lt;10<sup>7</sup>K is largely from spectral lines emitted by atoms.
<br>
On page 297, the last sentence of <font color="red"> Problem 7.8 </font> should refer to the result of Problem 3.12, not Problem 3.11.
<br>
On page 298, the <font color="red"> 
last term of Equation 7.12 </font> is upside down: it should read
(T/10<sup>7</sup>K)<sup>1/2</sup>, not  (10<sup>7</sup>K/T)<sup>1/2</sup>.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 8: The Large-scale Distribution of Galaxies</h2><p>
<font color="red"> 
In Equation 8.25 </font> on page 331,
the left side is missing a minus sign: it should be
- k c<sup>2</sup>/R<sup>2</sup>(t<sub>0</sub>). <br>
On page 333, <font color="red"> 
in Section 8.2.1</font>, in the fourth sentence of the opening 
paragraph, delete "z - &#916;z" to read 'Light from another galaxy at a 
slightly smaller redshift must have been emitted later by a small 
interval...'<br>
In the equation for t<sub>e</sub> <font color="red"> 
between Equations 8.33a and 8.33b, </font>
a prime is missing: the quantity in the square root should be (1 + &#937;<sub>0</sub>z') instead of (1 + &#937;<sub>0</sub>z).
<br> <font color="red"> 
In Section 8.3.3, </font> on page 343, the sentence following Equation 8.48 should read 'The right panel of Figure 8.8...', not 'left panel' 
</p>


<h2>Chapter 9: Active Galactic Nuclei and the Early History of Galaxies </h2><p> <font color="red"> 
In Section 9.1.3 </font>
we messed up the conversion between cgs and SI electromagnetic units.  In a vacuum, 1 tesla = 10<sup>4</sup>&thinsp;G, not 10<sup>6</sup>&thinsp;</sup>G.  <br>
So on page 379, <font color="red"> 
Equation 9.9 </font> should read 
&#957;<sub>c</sub> = 1.5 &#947;<sup>2</sup> &#957;<sub>L</sub> =
4.2 &#947;<sup>2</sup> B/(1G or 10<sup>-4</sup>&thinsp;T) MHz. <br>
<font color="red"> 
In Equations 9.12 and 9.13 </font>
for the half-energy-loss time t<sub>1/2</sub>, 10<sup>-11</sup>&thinsp;T should be replaced by 1nT (nanotesla). <br>
In the closing paragraph of Section 9.1.3, the field strength in giant radio lobes is 0.1-1 nT, not 10<sup>-11</sup>-10<sup>-12</sup>&thinsp;T.  
Thanks to John Wardle for spotting this!<br>
<font color="red"> In Problem 9.5 on page 382, </font>
the mass within the orbiting molecular gas ring is 5 x 10<sup>10</sup>&thinsp;M<sub>sun</sub>, ten times larger than is given in the text.  Thanks to Kirsten Kraiberg Knudsen! <br>
