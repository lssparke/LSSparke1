This book is a `with-calculus' introduction, aimed primarily at third-
and fourth-year undergraduate students of astronomy or physics, who
have taken the first year or two of university-level physics.
Graduate students and research workers in related areas may also find
it useful as an introduction to the field.  Some background knowledge
of astronomy would be helpful, but we have tried to summarize the
necessary facts and ideas in our introductory chapter.  Read our reviews on the Cambridge University Press pages, linked below.

get it back most of the time but not all, and it has gone
missing again.' -- Prof. Stephen E. Zepf, Michigan State University</p>

'The authors should have retained their working title:
"Galaxies for Geeks"' -- Jennifer L. Hoffman, Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Denver University

'Not thick enough to be really useful...' </p>
